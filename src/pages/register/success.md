# Thank you!

We're super stoked that you've signed up!
This really helps us tremendously organizing this event.

To receive announcements about neovimconf, you need to _confirm your e-mail-address_,
Check your inbox, click on the confirmation link and you're all set! As a token
of gratitude for your confirmation you'll receive a virtual ticket.

<p class="text-sm">
    Note: We're having some technical issues with the confirmations emails.
    So it might take longer than we'd like until you receive that mail. We're 
    currently investigating it.
