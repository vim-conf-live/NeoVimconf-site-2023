      <p>
        Signing up helps us a lot to organize this event.
        We're super stoked that you're doing this!
        After submitting, you'll have to confirm you e-mail address, which only 
        need to have an indicator of interest and we certainly won't give it 
        away to third parties or send you further mails without consent.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you want to receive some promotional reminder emails right before this year's 
        event, and receive a headsup for next year's neovimconf via email, make
        sure to tick that second box. Of course you can always opt-out or opt-in later.
