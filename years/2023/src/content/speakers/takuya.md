talk: "Designing a theme with a coordinated color scheme in HSL using Lua"
---

Hex and RGB are the most common formats for representing color but they're not the most useful.
When designing a theme, your color palette can be easily cluttered with the need to support numerous highlights.
By using HSL (Hue, Saturation, and Lightness) instead, you can maintain a color scheme that is consistent and well-coordinated.
In this talk, I'll share tips for efficiently designing a Neovim theme using HSL colors.
It will include how to highlight HSL code with `echasnovski/mini.hipatterns` so that you can align colors intuitively on Neovim.
