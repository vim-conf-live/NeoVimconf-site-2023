talk: "Nixvim: Configure Neovim with the power of Nix"
---

Nix is the dream of programmers who like to build reliable and reproducible software systems and environments.
It has shown to be very powerful for configuring Linux systems (NixOS), project development environments (nix-shell) or even user configurations (home-manager).
The goal of Nixvim is to leverage the immense nixpkgs software repository and the power of Nix modules to configure Neovim in a complete and reliable way.
