            <p>Vimconf.live is an inclusive community.</p>
            <h2 id="join-us">Join us!</h2>
            <p>
              We strive to create a friendly, welcoming, judgement- and
              harassment-free place for individuals to learn, connect, and share
              their appreciation for all things vim.
            </p>
            <p>
              We are a diverse, global community. We have members from every
              gender, sexuality, gender expression, race, ethnicity, tribal
              background, religious affiliation, citizenship and nationality,
              age, physical ability, educational background, experience level
              that you can think of - and want everyone to feel welcome!
            </p>
            <p>
              Whether attending our events, it’s not only our hope, but our
              expectation, that you’ll abide by these three basic ground rules:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>We approach interactions with thoughtfulness and care.</p>
                <p>
                  We are patient &amp; kind to others. We don’t dismiss someone
                  because they have a different level of experience, are of a
                  different background, or have a difference of opinion than us.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>We are respectful when we disagree with someone.</p>
                <p>
                  There is a human in front of us. We don’t allow frustration to
                  turn into a personal attack. A community where people feel
                  uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. We are
                  collectively responsible for each other.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>We work to correct mistakes when they occur.</p>
                <p>
                  No one is expected to always be perfect or to know everything
                  - sometimes even good intentions have unwanted outcomes. But
                  how we respond to criticism is important. If someone
                  criticizes our conduct, or points out ways we have harmed
                  someone, we listen without taking it personally, and work
                  towards a resolution - together.
                </p>

              violations and complaints to Vimconf.live staff within one week,
              regardless of how “severe” they are, so we can be accountable and

              Depending on the severity of the issue, the person may receive a
              last-chance warning, may be asked to leave the activity/group, or
              may receive a future ban. In very severe cases, we reserve the
              right to involve law enforcement should we feel it necessary.
