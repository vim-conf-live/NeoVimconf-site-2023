Do you want to contribute to Neovim but don't know how to get started? Are you interested in being an active contributor to your favourite `nvim` plugins, but find opening that first PR daunting? Then I hope you'll find some insights in my talk, where I'll share my experience in contributing to Neovim's LSP and Treesitter support, and how it compares to the other editors/IDEs I help maintain.
